    "# Getting started\n",
    "There are multiple blog posts explaining how to turn Jupyter notebooks into either Markdown\n",
    "or HTML files (e.g. [1](https://cduvallet.github.io/posts/2018/03/ipython-notebooks-jekyll),\n",
    "[2](https://jaketae.github.io/blog/jupyter-automation/),\n",
    "[3](http://www.kasimte.com/adding-and-including-jupyter-notebooks-as-jekyll-blog-posts))\n",
    "using `nbconvert`. If there are plots in the notebook, `nbconvert` turns them into png images\n",
    "which are then embedded in the Markdown document. Using the resulting files as Jekyll posts\n",
    "does then only require adjusting a few things like headers or image paths, moving the files\n",
    "in the right folder, and upload the result. This sounds like a viable option!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several additional options I found which don't perfectly fit for what I'm trying\n",
    "to achieve, but look very interesting:\n",
    "* [`fastpages`](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), a blogging platform which supports\n",
    "  Markdown and Jupyter notebooks (and even Word docs!). This looks extremely powerful, but\n",
    "  after some exploration I found that trying to fit the result into my existing site did not\n",
    "  yield satisfactory results. I think this is a great project, though!\n",
    "* [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org) turns notebooks into beautiful books\n",
    "  or articles. This looks amazing for standalone projects, but I don't see an easy way to fit\n",
    "  the result into my existing page.\n",
    "* [Jekyll Jupyter Notebook plugin](https://github.com/red-data-tools/jekyll-jupyter-notebook)\n",
    "  allows to embed Jupyter notebooks in Markdown documents used by Jekyll. This seems\n",
    "  really useful, but is not exactly what I'm looking for here - I would prefer to write the\n",
    "  entire post in a notebook rather than including a notebook into a Markdown post.\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to use `nbconvert` to create Markdown files (and not directly HTML). My reasoning was\n",
    "that this approach would have a higher likelihood to create posts with the right look, as they\n",
    "would be processed by Jekyll in the same way as the rest of the site. This also meant that I\n",
    "could write the YAML front matter for the posts in a Markdown cell, which should then be left\n",
    "alone by `nbconvert`. Finally, it would also mean that the automatic excerpt function of the\n",
    "Minimal Mistakes theme (taking the first paragraph as an excerpt if it isn't defined differently)\n",
    "should work properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Turning a Jupyter notebook into a Markdown Jekyll post\n",
    "\n",
    "## Naming and file organization\n",
    "When converting a Jupyter notebook to Markdown, `nbconvert` will by default write a Markdown file\n",
    "with the same base name as the notebook, changing only the file extension. The Markdown conversion\n",
    "of a notebook named `basename.ipynb` will be saved in a file called `basename.md`. Since Jekyll\n",
    "blog posts are required to be named as `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md` (\n",
    "[reference](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/)), it is easiest to follow that naming\n",
    "for notebooks. A notebook which should become a blog post should hence be named\n",
    "`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blog posts on Jekyll sites live in the `_posts` folder. I decided to follow the example of `fastpages`\n",
    "and create a `_notebooks` folder in which to store the notebooks. I will then move the resulting\n",
    "Markdown file into the `_posts` folder, where it will be picked up by Jekyll. I will also move the\n",
    "images into the `assets/images/` folder, which is the default location for images.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A bash script to convert Jupyter notebooks to Markdown Jekyll posts\n",
    "As a recap, here's the steps we need to take:\n",
    "* Use `nbconvert` to convert Jupyter notebook to Markdown\n",
    "* Change image paths from local paths to absolute paths in `assets/images/`\n",
    "* Move the resulting Markdown file into the `_posts` folder\n",
    "* Move the image folder to `assets/images/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can easily be done by a few lines of bash with some perl support (and a call to `jupyter nbconvert`\n",
    "which does the heavy-lifting, of course):\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Get file name without extension\n",
    "filename=\"${notebook_file%.*}\"\n",
    "# Name of Markdown file will be base name + \".md\"\n",
    "md_notebook=\"${filename}.md\"\n",
    "# Convert notebook to Markdown\n",
    "jupyter nbconvert \"$notebook_file\" --to markdown\n",
    "# Fix image links to point to a place where Jekyll will pick up the images\n",
    "{% raw %}perl -pi -e 's/\\[png\\]\\(/[png]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}\\/assets\\/images\\//g' \"$md_notebook\"{% endraw %}\n",
    "# Move Markdown notebook to _posts/ directory\n",
    "mv \"$md_notebook\" \"${root_directory}/_posts/\"\n",
    "# Move images to a assets such that Jekyll finds them\n",
    "mv \"${filename}_files\" \"${root_directory}/assets/images/\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Front matter\n",
    "Since `nbconvert` does not change the content of Markdown cells, I can simply define the first cell of the\n",
    "notebook to be a Markdown cell and write the YAML front matter there. For example, the first cell of this\n",
    "notebook reads\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "title: \"Turning Jupyter notebooks into Jekyll blog posts\"\n",
    "toc: true\n",
    "category: \"Blogging platform\"\n",
    "tags: [\"Jekyll\", \"Jupyter\", \"Minimal Mistakes\"]\n",
    "badges: true\n",
    "---\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`nbconvert` will simply print that as the first lines of the created Markdown file. Jekyll will then interpret\n",
    "these lines as the YAML front matter, and will render the rest of the post based on the settings set here. I'm pretty\n",
    "satisfied with this solution: It's easy and intuitive to write, and it doesn't impair the functionality of\n",
    "the notebook in any way.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Links to GitHub and Google Colab\n",
    "Having a way to get the source notebook on GitHub or run in on Google Colab is a great feature that I\n",
    "really enjoy on other pages, so I'd love to have that on my blog. [`fastpages`](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)\n",
    "has built-in functionality to add badges that I think works and looks great, so I will try to replicate\n",
    "some of that behavior here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Links\n",
    "Links to files on GitHub do generally have the form \n",
    "`https://github.com/<GitHub username or organization>/<repository name>/blob/<branch>/<file path>`. \n",
    "\n",
    "To run notebooks stored on GitHub in Google Colab, the link has the form\n",
    "`https://colab.research.google.com/github/<GitHub username or organization>/<repository name>/blob/<branch>/<file path>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing this, it's easy to create links to the notebook generating a blog post.\n",
    "I am serving my site from the `main` branch, and in my file\n",
    "organization mentioned above the notebook is going to be under `_notebooks/<filename>`. Note that the\n",
    "repository name can be set in the Jekyll configuration, so if the `repository` tag was set in `_config.yml`, the\n",
    "repository information in the link can be filled by Jekyll. To achieve this, I simply replaced \n",
    "`<GitHub username or organization>/<repository name>` by `{% raw %}{{ site.repository }}{% endraw %}`. So my links\n",
    "are going to read<br>\n",
    "`https://github.com/{% raw %}{{site.repository}}{% endraw %}/blob/main/_notebooks/<filename>`<br>\n",
    "for GitHub and<br>\n",
    "`https://colab.research.google.com/github/{% raw %}{{site.repository}}{% endraw %}/blob/main/_notebooks/<filename>`<br>\n",
    "for Google Colab.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Badges\n",
    "Google Colab offers a badge which looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)\n",
    "\n",

    "![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=Open%20on%20GitHub&logo=github&color=lightgray&labelColor=gray)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Including badges in blog posts\n",
    "To include the badges in blog posts, I decided, again inspired by `fastpages`, to add a new layout called `notebook` to Minimal Mistakes. That new\n",
    "layout is the same as the default `single` layout, but adds the badges. This solution has a couple of nice properties:\n",
    "* It's update friendly: If the `single` layout is changed, `notebook` is updated accordingly.\n",
    "* It works with the default excerpts: By default, the excerpt which is used to create the pagination links is done by\n",
    "  taking the first few lines of the content of the post. If the badges were part of the content, the standard excerpt\n",
    "  of all posts would start with the (non-rendered) code for the badges. By introducing the new layout and making the\n",
    "  badges part of the layout rather than the content, we are avoiding this problem.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The new layout is only a few lines long and lives in `_layouts/notebook.html`:\n",
