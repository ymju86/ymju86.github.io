Metrics for Business
- Build metrics: 
Monthly Revenue, Monthly Active Customers, Monthly Order Count, Average Revenue per Order, 
New Customer Ratio, Activation Rate, Monthly Retention Rate, Churn Rate, Cohort Base Retention

Customer Segmentation
- RFM: Recency, Frequency, Monetary value (Revenue)
- The main strategies are quite clear:
•	High Value: Improve Retention
•	Mid Value: Improve Retention + Increase Frequency
•	Low Value: Increase Frequency

Customer Lifetime Value Prediction
- RFM: Recency, Frequency, Monetary value (Revenue)
- LTV (Life Time Value), Accuracy, Precision, Recall

Predicting Next Purchase Day
-	Data Wrangling (creating previous/next datasets and calculate purchase day differences)
-	Feature Engineering
-	Selecting a Machine Learning Model
-	Multi-Classification Model
-	Hyperparameter Tuning
