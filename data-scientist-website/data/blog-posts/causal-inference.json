  "content": "# Causal Inference\n\nCausal inference is a critical field that helps us understand the effect of treatments or interventions. The CausalInference package in Python provides tools for estimating these effects.\n\n## Setting and Notation\n\nLet Y(0) denote the potential outcome of a subject in the absence of treatment, and let Y(1) denote the unit's potential outcome when it is treated. Let D denote treatment status, with D = 1 indicating treatment and D = 0 indicating control, and let X be a K-column vector of covariates or individual characteristics.\n\nFor unit i, i = 1, 2, ..., N, the observed outcome can be written as:\n\nY_i = (1 - D_i)Y_i(0) + D_i Y_i(1)\n\n## Key Methods\n\n1. **Propensity Score Estimation**: Estimates the probability of receiving treatment given covariates\n2. **Stratification**: Divides the sample into bins based on propensity score\n3. **Treatment Effect Estimation**: Methods include:\n   - OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)\n   - Weighting\n   - Blocking\n   - Matching\n\n## Example Implementation\n\n```python\nfrom causalinference import CausalModel\nfrom causalinference.utils import random_data\n\n# Generate random data\nY, D, X = random_data()\n\n# Initialize the causal model\ncausal = CausalModel(Y, D, X)\n\n# View summary statistics\nprint(causal.summary_stats)\n\n# Estimate propensity scores\ncausal.est_propensity_s()\nprint(causal.propensity)\n\n# Stratify the sample\ncausal.stratify_s()\nprint(causal.strata)\n\n# Estimate treatment effects\ncausal.est_via_ols()\ncausal.est_via_weighting()\ncausal.est_via_blocking()\ncausal.est_via_matching(bias_adj=True)\nprint(causal.estimates)\n```\n\nThis approach allows researchers to estimate causal effects from observational data, providing insights into the impact of interventions when randomized experiments are not feasible."
