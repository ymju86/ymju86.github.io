## Selected Publications & Projects

- **Control Function Approach for Partly Ordered Endogenous Treatments: Military Rank Premium in Wage**  
  *Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics, June 2017*  
  Developed a novel statistical methodology to analyze the effects of military ranks on post-service wages, addressing endogeneity in rank assignment through an innovative control function approach.

- **A Study on Scale of Defense Expenditure for Security Menace: A Panel Regression Analysis Approach**  
  *Journal of Korea Army Academy at Yeong-cheon, 2013*  
  Led a government research project to design robust economic models for estimating optimal national defense R&D expenditure and efficient management, contributing to a larger project with a total value exceeding $40,000.

- **Affirmative Action in Korea - Regression Discontinuity with Multiple Assignment Variables**  
  *Dissertation Research, 2021*  
  Developed an identification method for fuzzy regression discontinuity design with multiple assignment variables to analyze affirmative action effects in Korea. Found that while the overall policy showed no significant effect, company size-based implementation increased female employment rates by 5 percentage points.

- **Store Item Demand Forecasting Project**  
  *Technical Report, 2021*  
  Implemented a Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) using Keras/TensorFlow to predict 3-month item sales across different stores, supporting business planning and cash flow management. The LSTM model reduced error rates to 86% of traditional ARIMA forecasting methods.

- **Customer Churn Prediction Project**  
  *Technical Report, 2020*  
  Built a multi-classification model using XGBoost to identify customers likely to churn and determine the most influential features. The XGBoost model achieved an AUC of 93.3%, outperforming other algorithms including GBM (90.89%), Random Forest (87.76%), and Decision Trees (83%).

- **Online Retail Customer Segmentation Analysis**  
  *Technical Report, 2020*  
  Segmented and cleaned business performance metrics including monthly revenue, activation rate, retention rate, and churn rate. Applied Lifetime Value (LTV) methods to improve multi-classification model accuracy from 76.5% to 84%.

- **A Study on the Estimation of Optimal Defense R&D Expenditure and Efficient Management**
  *Korea Army Academy at Yeongcheon, 2012*
  Conducted comprehensive research on defense R&D expenditure optimization and management efficiency, providing evidence-based recommendations for resource allocation in national defense.

- **The Study on Scale of Defense Expenditure**
  *Korea Army Academy at Yeongcheon, 2011*
  Analyzed defense expenditure patterns and requirements, developing models to determine appropriate funding levels based on security threats and national priorities.

- **Economic Effects of Alleged Anti-Competitive Behavior of Top Automobile Parts Company**
  *Research Report for Hyundai MOBIS, 2010*
  Designed causal inference models to investigate economic effects of alleged anti-competitive behaviors on retail agencies, mediating companies, repair shops, and consumers. The research provided economic evidence that helped reduce the imposed fine from $150 million to $30 million.
